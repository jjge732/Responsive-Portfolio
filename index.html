            Although I was raised in Aurora, I was born at Northwestern Hospital, so I feel at home here! I really enjoy working out and listening to music. Some of my favorite artists are Halsey, Panic! at the Disco, Lil Skies, & Biometrix.

            I have one brother and a dog. My brother is two years older than me and lives in the city. My dog is a 7 year old terrier mix.
